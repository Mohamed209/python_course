question 1 :
assume you have an array of integers with duplicates , for example
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8]
write a python script to get user input list with duplicates and perform two tasks
1- print frequency table of the list where every element is mapped with its occurances
{1:2,2:2,3:1,5:1,6:1,7:1} , here 1 found two times , 2 found 2 times and so on
2- print new list with only unique items for example in previous list you should return
[1,2,3,5,6,7,8]

question 2 :
Given two strings s1 and s2, check if both the strings are anagrams of each other
An anagram of a string is another string that contains same characters, only the order of characters can be different. 
For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are anagram of each other
for example
Input : s1 = "listen"
        s2 = "silent"
Output : The strings are anagrams.


Input : s1 = "dad"
        s2 = "bad"
Output : The strings aren't anagrams.

question 3:
Given a long sentence, reverse each word of the sentence individually in the sentence itself.
Examples:

Input : 'Geeks For Geeks is good to learn'
Output : 'skeeG roF skeeG si doog ot nrael'

Input : 'Split Reverse Join'
Output : 'tilpS esreveR nioJ'

write a python function str_to_num() that accepts input string of numbers , and evaluates its integer value
for example str_to_num('124') >>> will return 124
note : do not use int()
